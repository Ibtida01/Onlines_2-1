## How it Works

### Step 1: Understand the Decimal Complement

The complement of 7 in decimal is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Complement of 7} = 9 - X \]
\[ = (10 - 1) - X \]
\[ = 2 \]

### Step 2: Convert to Binary

Now, we convert the result (2) to binary. In binary, 2 is represented as \( 10_2 \). Therefore, the binary representation of the complement of 7 is \( 10_2 \).

### Step 3: Generalization

We can generalize the process for any binary number X. The formula becomes:

\[ \text{Complement of X in Binary} = 1 - X \]


To calculate the complement of a binary number, follow these steps:

1. Take the binary input (X).
2. Subtract the binary input (X) from 1 in binary.

## Example

Let's take an example where X is 101 in binary.

\[ \text{Complement of 101} = 1 - 101 \]
\[ = 1 - (5_{10}) \]
\[ = 1 - (101_{2}) \]
\[ = 1_{2} - (101_{2}) \]
\[ = (10_{2}) - (101_{2}) \]
\[ = (1_{2}) \]

Therefore, the complement of 101 in binary is \( 1_2 \).
